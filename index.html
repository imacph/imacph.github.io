    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a scientific computing specialist with a BSc in Physics and currently completing my MSc thesis in fluid dynamics. Over the past five years, I’ve worked as a research assistant, where I developed and deployed simulation tools for studying complex physical systems — including a custom Python program used to analyze solutions to PDEs in fluid mechanics, resulting in a first-author publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.</p>
    <p>My technical skill set spans Python, Julia, MATLAB, and SQL, with practical experience running and scaling simulations on HPC clusters using SLURM. I've also worked with SQLite databases, and I've deployed and modified FORTRAN codebases for high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>I’m comfortable with object-oriented programming, scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and pandas, and I have hands-on experience with machine learning workflows for research analysis. While I haven’t yet built full-stack applications, I’m currently expanding into frontend and web development to complement my strong backend and scientific computing background.</p>
    <p>I value clarity in both code and communication — I enjoy writing technical documentation, sharing knowledge through public talks, and building tools that make complex science more accessible. I'm especially interested in bridging the gap between research and software engineering through open-source projects, scientific web apps, and interactive data tools.</p>

                <h3 class="project-title">AxisymmLinStab.jl</h3>
                <p class="project-description">This Julia package performs numerical linear stability analysis of rotating fluid flow in a spherical shell. It time-steps the linearized Navier–Stokes equations to evaluate the growth or decay of perturbations, identifying unstable modes and critical parameters. Designed for deployment on HPC clusters, the package supports scalable investigations in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics.</p>

                <h3 class="project-title">BatchTrace</h3>
                <p class="project-description">This project is a shell- and Python-based framework for automating large-scale simulation campaigns on SLURM-managed HPC clusters. It handles array job submission, routes output to long-term storage, and logs simulation parameters and metadata in an SQL database that indexes file locations. The system supports reproducible, traceable workflows across wide parameter sweeps, minimizing manual effort and simplifying downstream analysis.</p>

                <h3 class="project-title">spherical_flows</h3>
                <p class="project-description">Spherical Flows computes the time‑periodic linear response of a homogeneous, rapidly rotating Newtonian fluid confined to a spherical shell. It efficiently solves the associated boundary‑value problem using spectral methods (spherical harmonics), enabling analysis of time‑periodic fluid behavior under various boundary conditions—ideal for studying geophysical or astrophysical rotating fluid systems.</p>
