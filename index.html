    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a scientific computing specialist with a BSc in Physics and currently completing my MSc thesis in fluid dynamics. Over the past five years, I’ve worked as a research assistant, where I developed and deployed simulation tools for studying complex physical systems — including a custom Python program used to analyze solutions to PDEs in fluid mechanics, resulting in a first-author publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.</p>
    <p>My technical skill set spans Python, Julia, MATLAB, and SQL, with practical experience running and scaling simulations on HPC clusters using SLURM. I've also worked with SQLite databases, and I've deployed and modified FORTRAN codebases for high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>I’m comfortable with object-oriented programming, scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and pandas, and I have hands-on experience with machine learning workflows for research analysis. While I haven’t yet built full-stack applications, I’m currently expanding into frontend and web development to complement my strong backend and scientific computing background.</p>
    <p>I value clarity in both code and communication — I enjoy writing technical documentation, sharing knowledge through public talks, and building tools that make complex science more accessible. I'm especially interested in bridging the gap between research and software engineering through open-source projects, scientific web apps, and interactive data tools.</p>
